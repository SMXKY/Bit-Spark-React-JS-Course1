Part I: The basics of React components //Refer to example 1 after explaining each point
-> What is a function in Javascript?
    Think of a function a menu option in a restaurant, when the chef creates a menu option for a dish, he
    outlines the steps on how to create the dish and the ingredients required. The results of following this
    recipie leads to the dish.(Function reusability) Now any time a client request for that dish the 
    chef can just go to his book 
    of recipies follow the steps and in returns he gets the desired dish every time. Assiteant chefs dont need
    to know the science or art behind the recipie all the need to do is follow it when needed and it results 
    in the required dish.

-> What is a return value for a function?
    The return value in a function is the dish, that comes as a result of following the reciepie

-> What are funciton parameters
    Funtion parameters are the ingredients in the reciepie, their amounts can be modified to vary the outcome
    of the resulting dish

Part II: The basics of rendering a html using a function
-> A function can be used to render the HTML in the DOM
//Go to example 2, Do it with them step by step

Part III: Components.
i. What is a react JS Component? 
-> It is a re-usable piece of code that returns JSX
ii. What is JSX, and what does it stand for?
-> It stands for Javascript XML, and It enebles html like syntax to be written in a javasript file

iii. How does Javasript render JSX in the background
//React conversts jsx into regular javasript that is understood by the browser, using a tool call babel
so that it can be rendered in the browser

iv. Writing our first component
-> Go to your app folder in vs code
-> Enter the src(source) folder
-> Create a folder called components
-> The basic good practices to creating components:
    1. Create them in a seperate folder 
    2. Each component should have its own file
    3. component file names should match the component name
    4. componet name and file name should start with capital letters
    5. If there are multiple html elements in a component they must be wrapped in parent html elemen/tag
    6. In jsx single tags are written as follows: <br />
-> create a file called studentInfo.js
-> //Create the component with them step by step
-> The format for creating components:
    function ComponentName(){
        return //jsx
    }
